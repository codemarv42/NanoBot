# NanoBot

The NanoBot is basically a small robot, which was developed for educational purposes. It comes with a variety of sensors such as light sensors, color sensors, distance sensors and with the paired Jetson Nano from Nvidia with one or more cameras. In addition, you can connect even more modules and sensors through the extra pins, making the limits almost infinite.
